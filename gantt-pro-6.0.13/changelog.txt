6.0.0     2018-08-10

    We are proud to present the 6.0 release of Gantt for Ext JS. In this release you will find a lot of enhancements and bug fixes, as well as support for Ext JS 6.6. There are also
    a few breaking changes as part of our house cleaning (please see Breaking Changes section below for details). Starting with this release,
    we no longer support IE8, IE9 or IE10.

    The most notable update in this release is the new support for backwards scheduling. With backward scheduling you plan the project backwards
    from the deadline date when the project should finish, and you schedule your tasks based on that fixed date. All tasks in this mode are placed as late as possible by default.
    The project start date in this mode is flexible and calculated based on the project tasks. This method allows you to estimate the latest possible date the project could start without breaking the deadline.

    Here are some tips that might help you to migrate to 6.6.0:
    Please be aware of Sencha has introduced strict JSON validation when loading the AJAX proxy. Your server should return a valid JSON format.
    Using the native JSON any date object will be converted to ISO 8601 UTC format ("2018-01-01T06:00:00.000Z"), however you are safe since model field's dateFormat is configured as "c". If you wish to follow the native JSON standard, you may change the dateFormat to "C".
    Ext CRUD operations now destroyable, so you need to process your response as soon as possible, until the operation is destroyed and data is cleaned up.

    [SUPPORTED EXT JS VERSIONS]
    - 6.6.0
    - 6.5.3

    [KNOWN ISSUES]
    - Note column is not supported in FireFox #4412.

    [FEATURES / ENHANCEMENTS]
    - Added Ext JS 6.6.0 support (Fixed #6517).
    - Added support for backwards scheduling of projects. See the new ´backwardscheduling´ demo for a demonstration and `Gnt.data.TaskStore` class `scheduleBackwards` config docs for usage details.
    - Task model now allows configuring the segments model (Fixed #5952).
    - Task editor widget has been changed to apply task changes in a single propagation process. In the Gantt 5.x, every field change caused a separate propagation which was bad for performance (Fixed #5170).
    - Added support for "Group by" feature. Check the ´grouping´ demo for details (Fixed #2418).
    - Added `enableGroupingMenu` config to the Gantt panel, which controls if the grouping options are shown in the column menu.
    - MS Project import demo (JAVA version) has been upgraded to support backward scheduled projects, ASAP/ALAP constraints and calendars data (Fixed #2616).
    - Added support for high-contrast accessibility Aria theme (Fixed #5194).
    - Task `linkTo` method has been changed to support dependency config options like `Lag` and `LagUnit` (Fixed #5753).
    - The `Gnt.widget.AssignmentGrid` component (picker of the resource assignment field) has been changed to trigger changes propagation to take constraints validation into account (Fixed #5538). Use the `Gnt.widget.AssignmentGrid#propagateChanges` config to switch back to the old behavior.
    - New flag introduced, that allows to modify duration on effort driven tasks without any assigned resources. Config name is `enableSetDurationOnEffortDrivenTask`, enabled by default (Fixed #6513).
    - Added a new Angular 5 example (Fixed #6201).
    - Dependency hover tooltip is now supported (inherited from Scheduler).
    - ASP.NET + Java versions of export scripts.

    [BREAKING API CHANGES]
    - Dropped support for IE8/9/10 (Fixed #5618).
    - Deleted all static theme images from resources (Fixed #6267).
    - Provided `disableDateAdjustments` config on `Gnt.panel.Gantt` class. It disables all displayed start/end dates adjustment. The config is enabled by default. Set it to `false` to rollback to the 5.x displaying (Fixed #5310).
    - Task model class `getSlack` method removed as deprecated. Use `getFreeSlack` instead.
    - `Gnt.feature.TaskDragDrop` class removed. Use `Gnt.features.taskdd.DragZone` instead.
    - `Gnt.model.mixin.ProjectableModel` class `initProjectable` method removed as deprecated.
    - `Gnt.panel.Gantt` class `keepSelection` config removed as deprecated.
    - `Gnt.field.mixin.TaskField` class `taskField` config removed as deprecated. Use `fieldProperty` instead.

      The view switches between those modes automaticaly, a configuration option has been added to setup
      dependencies amount limit when the view should switch from bulk to async mode and vise-versa, as well
      as an option for async mode batch size.

5.0.0     2016-11-06

    We're very happy to announce v5.0.0 of our Gantt product. This release contains a few new goodies as well as some
    much needed clean up of old deprecated APIs (see section belog for notes on breaking changes). Notable additions:

    * Component styling is now based on SASS, just like in Ext JS. This makes it much easier to theme parts of the Gantt component using SASS variables.
    * New Kitchen sink for easier browsing of the examples
    * New 'render to div' demo showing how to integrate the Scheduler into a basic HTML web page
    * New demo 'schedulerdependencies' showing how Scheduler can use the Gantt task store to schedule Gantt tasks
    * Updated styling for all samples
    * Various clean up minor bug fixes, outlined below

    [SUPPORTED EXT JS VERSIONS]
    - 6.0.1

    - When new flag `autoCalculateLag` is set to `true` on the dependencystore, the lag of incoming dependencies of a task will be adjusted before start- or enddate update (Fixed #2984).
    - New demo showing a scheduler visualising a Gantt task store, with dependencies and scheduling logic applied (Fixed #3373).
    - Kitchensink containing all examples added, browse to examples to see it in action
    - Added a new ´readOnly´ config (true by default) to Gnt.panel.Timeline. Set to ´false´ to enable drag drop of tasks in the timeline (Fixed #3302).

4.2.4     2016-07-19

    [SUPPORTED EXT JS VERSIONS]
    - 6.0.1
    - 6.0.2

    [KNOWN ISSUES]

    [FEATURES / ENHANCEMENTS]
    - Various minor performance improvements made, mainly in the main render loop producing task markup. The rendering process no
    longer applies *all* task data fields to the Task template. If you use Task model data fields inside your task template,
    you should provide them through the 'eventRenderer' method.

    [API CHANGES]
    - The Gnt.panel.Gantt#tooltipTpl config now also accepts a Boolean value. The default value is now set to ´true´ which will create a default task tooltip showing
     StartDate, EndDate and PercentDone information when on hovering over a task. Set the ´tooltipTpl´ config to ´false´ to not use the standard tooltip. The new task template for the tooltip is
      localised and added to the API. You can still configure your own task tooltip using a String or Ext.Template value, which you can see in the 'gantt-scheduler' example.

    We're pleased to announce the 3.0 Release Candidate. THe examples and source code have been updated to be based on Ext JS 5.1.0.
    The main focus of this release has been stability and test fixes. We have also upgraded our export feature to work with
    the Ext JS buffered rendering of large data sets.

   [SUPPORTED EXT JS VERSIONS]
    - 5.1.0

3.0.0-beta-2 2014-11-10
    This Ext Gantt release introduces task constraints support and task split support. Over the years, these have been
    frequently requested and we are happy to tell you that these features are now fully supported. Additionally, we have added
    a new CRUD manager, which makes it a lot easier to handle loading and saving data in the component. You can of course read
    all about the new features in our guide section of our documentation site.

   [SUPPORTED EXT JS VERSIONS]
    - 5.0.1

    [KNOWN ISSUES]
    - Some translations are missing for non-English languages
    - Export feature is not yet adapted to handle buffered rendering (which is on by default in Ext JS 5)
    - Documentation of the new features is still in progress.

    [FEATURES / ENHANCEMENTS]
    - Improved Touch support: Inline editing, column drag drop and resize, task Drag drop, task resize, scrolling and setting up dependencies supported.

    [API CHANGES]
    - The semantic of "ManuallyScheduled" field has been changed so that such task is only not affected by incoming dependencies
      and constraints. Also, the manually scheduled parent task is not affected by its child tasks positions and behaves like
      any other normal task. The holidays skipping rules are still applied to such tasks, according to it's (or project's) calendar.
      Previously the holiday skipping rules were not applied to such tasks. To re-enable the old behavior, create a 24/7h calendar
      in your project and assign it to such tasks.
    - The “Manual” value of the SchedulingMode field is deprecated in favor of the “ManuallyScheduled” field (so that a task can be “manually scheduled” and have a scheduling mode in the same time)
    - The TaskStore#loadData method has been deprecated (as it exists natively in Ext JS 5.0)

    [BUG FIXES]
    - Fixed #1482: Resource model forEachAvailabilityIntervalWithTasks treats assignments calendars in a different way than task forEachAvailabilityInterval* does
    - Fixed #1575: Wrong project calendar is used in TaskEditor
    - Fixed #1592: Baseline % complete ignored
    - Fixed #1595: 1px offset when resizing or dragging task segment
    - Fixed #1600: Cmd 5 warnings for 3.x branch
    - Fixed #1611: Unhighlighing tasks causes exception
    - Fixed #1627: Selection model issues after filtering
    - Fixed #1628: Task availability iterator misses start/end dates for business time tasks
    - Fixed #1629: Task segments field should get into modified fields set after task move
    - Fixed #1631: German translation of dependency types
    - Fixed #1652: Histogram example tooltip enddate
    - Fixed #1669: Zoom to fit works incorrectly
    - Fixed #1677: Possible to create parent dependencies during inline editing
    - Fixed #1678: Dependencies refreshed after editing completed without change

3.0.0-beta-1 2014-09-25

    We're excited to announce the first public beta release of Ext Gantt 3.0. The code base has been upgraded to
    run on Ext JS 5.0.1, which adds some great new features like touch support to the Gantt component. The most notable
    new Gantt features in this release are the task constraints support and task split support. Over the years, these have been

    a new CRUD manager, which makes it a lot easier to handle loading and saving data in the component. You can of course read
    all about the new features in our guide section of our documentation site.

    Starting from this release, we no longer support IE7 since Ext JS 5 has dropped support for it.

    This is a beta release, so expect some rough edges here and there. We would be very happy to hear your feedback and
    please report any bugs in our new Ext Gantt 3.x forums: https://bryntum.com/forum/viewforum.php?f=33

      "manually scheduled" and has some scheduling mode in the same time)
    - getCount on TaskStore is now available in the superclass (TreeStore), our old method was renamed to getTotalCount. Might be a breaking change since we cannot override this safely anymore.

2.2.13    2013-11-20

    [SUPPORTED EXT JS VERSIONS]
    - 4.2.1
    - 4.2.2

    [KNOWN ISSUES]

    [FEATURES / ENHANCEMENTS]
    - Introduced new task properties - `successors` and `predecessors`, containing outgoing and incoming dependencies
      respectively. These properties cache the dependencies of a task, to avoid doing full scans
      of dependency store in various scenarios.
    - Implemented caching of the `hasTransitiveDependency` method, which makes the `strictDependencyValidation` checks
      more performant
    - Added a new `Gnt.plugin.TaskEditor` (and `Gnt.widget.TaskEditor`) config `assignmentGridClass` which allows you to
      provide your own implementation of the `Gnt.widget.AssignmentEditGrid` widget.

    [API CHANGES]
    - Implemented protection against cyclic dependencies during a "cascadeChanges" operation
    - The optional `dependencyStore` argument of the `hasIncomingDependencies, hasOutgoingDependencies, getAllDependencies`
      methods was removed
    - The optional `dependencyStore` argument of the `getIncomingDependencies` and `getOutgoingDependencies` methods
      was replaced with `doNotClone` argument
    - The `Sch.config.locale` option has been removed, as causing too many troubles with Sencha Cmd. Gantt now always "requires"
      english locale. Also, english locale now does not overwrite the other active non-english locale

    [BUG FIXES]
    - The "isValidDependency" method of the Gnt.data.DependencyStore now correctly returns `false` for transitive dependencies
    - Fixed #1033: problem with long projects
    - Fixed #1050: When normal grid is collapsed, normal grid should get a vertical scroller.
    - Fixed #1054: On replaceChild in some cases parend node shown as leaf
    - Fixed #1060: Changing the "% done" field should not trigger a cascade

      start dates of the child tasks). Documented the previously private `allowParentTaskMove` option. See also "enableDependenciesForParentTasks"
      option in the Gnt.data.TaskStore class. (Fixed #169)
    - Implemented limited support for setting dependencies to/from parent tasks. Please refer to "enableDependenciesForParentTasks"

    The information previously stored in the "Id" field should be now stored in the new field "Type", "Weekday", "OverrideStartDate",
    "OverrideEndDate". This fixes a lot of issues with calendars CRUD. Calendar still can be loaded with the data in old format,
    but you should not rely on this anymore.
    - BREAKING: The internals of advanced calendar widget were significantly refactored. This feature was not documented so hopefully this change
    will not affect anyone - the public API remains the same
    - Added a new 'Note' field to the Task model.

    [BUG FIXES]
    - Fixed #616: Get a Javascript error after I delete a predecessor from the task context menu
    - Fixed #584: Right-hand border of the last column
