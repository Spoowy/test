Thanks for your downloading the Ext Gantt! 

Ext Gantt is a very interactive Gantt chart built on the fantastic Ext JS framework (made by Sencha Inc). It can help you manage your projects and tasks. It supports drag and drop, critical chain, inter-task relationships and much more. The component has no server dependencies whatsoever, meaning it will work together with any backend such as ASP.NET, Java, PHP and Ruby. 
Note: To view the examples you need to run them in a web server context, since they use Ajax to load the chart data.

If you are new to Ext JS or if you want to improve your existing Ext JS skills, we also offer an introduction course that covers the most important aspects of the platform. For more information please visit https://www.bryntum.com/training/.

To use this component you also need a valid commercial license of Ext JS. To learn which license is right for you or your company, please see https://www.sencha.com/products/extjs/#overview
